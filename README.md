# Sales-Forecasting-with-Time-Series-Analysis
Sales Forecasting with Time-Series Analysis

Overview:

This repository contains a project on sales forecasting using Python, with a focus on time-series analysis. The forecasting model utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) algorithm to predict future sales trends based on historical sales data. The project demonstrates techniques for handling time-series data, exploring stationarity, and implementing ARIMA for forecasting.

Features:

- Data loading and preparation from a structured source (e.g., CSV, DataFrame).
- Stationarity analysis using rolling statistics and differencing techniques.
- Implementation of ARIMA model for time-series forecasting.
- Visualization of actual sales trends and predicted values.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Step 4: Check Stationarity of the Data: ARIMA assumes the time series is stationary. If it's not, use differencing to make it stationary

Step 5: Fit the ARIMA Model: Identify the p, d, and q parameters using ACF and PACF plots
